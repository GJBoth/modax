# Notes about current folder
In this folder we try to get differentiable forward solver going, on both the bayesian regression and the SBL.
We can make basically make a grid with 2 rows and columns - explicit / implicit, and bayesian regression / SBL.
I had implicit differentiation working with bayesian regression, and its also the simplest approach, so we start with
explicit method for BR, than get implicit method working again and then move to SBL.
